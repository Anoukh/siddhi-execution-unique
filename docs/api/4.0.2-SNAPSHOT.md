### Syntax

```
timeBatch(<INT|LONG|FLOAT|BOOL|DOUBLE> unique.key, <INT|LONG> window.time, <INT|LONG> start.time)

### Examples

#### Example 1

```
define stream LoginEvents (timeStamp long, ip string) ;
from LoginEvents#window.unique:ever(ip)
select count(ip) as ipCount, ip 
insert all events into UniqueIps  ;
```
<p style="word-wrap: break-word">The above query determines the latest events arrived from the LoginEvents stream based on the ip attribute. At a given time, all the events held in the window should have a unique value for the ip attribute.

The expired events which have been expired as a result of being replaced by a newer event are directed to the uniqueIps output stream.</p>

## length _(Window)_

<p style="word-wrap: break-word">This is a sliding length window that holds the latest window length unique events according to the unique key parameter and gets updated for each event arrival and expiry. When a new event arrives with the key that is already there in the window, then the previous event is expired and new event is kept within the window.</p>

When the CseEventStream receives an event of which the value for the symbol attribute is the same as that of an existing event in the window, the existing event is replaced by the new event. All the events are returned to the OutputStream event stream once an event is expired or added to the window.</p>

## firstLengthBatch _(Window)_

<p style="word-wrap: break-word">This is a batch (tumbling) window that holds a specific number of unique events (depending on which events arrive first).
